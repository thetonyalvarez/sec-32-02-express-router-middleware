# Express Shopping List

For this exercise we will be building a simple JSON API application where we will store a shopping list. You should use an **array** to store your items in the shopping list.

Each item should be a JavaScript object with the keys of name, and price.

Remember that since you are using an **array** for storage, this will be cleared each time the server restarts. Create a simple file called fakeDb.js which contains the following:

```js
global.items = [];

module.exports = items;
```

Use this list of items in your routes and test files.

Your application should have the following routes:

1.  `GET /items` - this should render a list of shopping items.

> Here is what a response looks like:
>
> `[{“name”: “popsicle”, “price”: 1.45}, {“name”:”cheerios”, “price”: 3.40}]`

2.  `POST /items` - this route should accept JSON data and add it to the shopping list.

> Here is what a sample request/response looks like:
>
> `{“name”:”popsicle”, “price”: 1.45} => {“added”: {“name”: “popsicle”, “price”: 1.45}}`

3.  `GET /items/:name` - this route should display a single item’s name and price.

> Here is what a sample response looks like:
>
> `{“name”: “popsicle”, “price”: 1.45}`

4.  `PATCH /items/:name`, this route should modify a single item’s name and/or price.

> Here is what a sample request/response looks like:
>
> `{“name”:”new popsicle”, “price”: 2.45} => {“updated”: {“name”: “new popsicle”, “price”: 2.45}}`

5.  `DELETE /items/:name` - this route should allow you to delete a specific item from the array.

    Here is what a sample response looks like:

> `{message: “Deleted”}`

Please make use of the [Express Router](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html#express.Router).

STOP and make sure your routes are tested

Make sure you have tested all of these routes with Jest and Supertest.

## Further Study

1.  Make your own data store! Read/Write to a JSON file instead of using an array for storage.
2.  Use OOP to help refactor your logic for reading/writing. This is almost like building your own ORM!
3.  Build a front-end that interacts with your API. This will involve figuring out how to load static assets with express. Try doing this in jQuery, or vanilla JavaScript (ultra challenge)!
